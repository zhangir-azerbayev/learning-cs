Outline: 
1. [WIP] Solve every exercise in *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, Abelson and Sussman, 2nd edition.
2. Solve every exercise in *The Elements of Computing Systems*, Nisan and Schocken.
3. Solve every exercise in *The C Programming Language*, k&r. 
4. [Queued] Solve every exercise in the following chapters of *Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach*, Patterson and Hennessy, 5th edition:
    * Chapter 1: Fundamentals
    * Appendix B: Memory Hierarchy
    * Appendix C: Pipelining
  
5. [Queued] Data structures in C.
    - Implement data structures in [Aspnes' notes](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/classes/223/notes.html)

6. [Queued] C++ programming.
    - Follow the [C++ tutorial](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
