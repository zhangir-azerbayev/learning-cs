# actually-learning-cs
Learning computer science, properly. High-level overview of computer architecture; data structures and algorithms in Rust.

Outline: 
1. [WIP] Solve every exercise in *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, Abelson and Sussman, 2nd edition. 

2. [Queued] Solve every exercise in the following chapters of *Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach*, Patterson and Hennessy, 5th edition:
    * Chapter 1: Fundamentals
    * Appendix B: Memory Hierarchy
    * Appendix C: Pipelining
  
3. [Queued] Data structures in C.
    - Implement data structures in [Aspnes' notes](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/classes/223/notes.html)

5. [Queued] C++ programming.
    - Follow the [C++ tutorial](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
